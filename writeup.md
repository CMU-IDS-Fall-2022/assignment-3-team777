### Abstract
The data source is Storm Tracks. Our main goal is to exhibit the tracks of certain storms and their statistical relationship among the features of data. We achieve this by preprocessing the data and drawing interactive scatter plot, bar plot, heatmap, and the world map.


## Project Goals

Questions we want users to answer: What are the tracks of and patterns of the storms? What is the relationship among wind speed, pressure, date, storm type, duration of storms, and storm diameters?


## Design

We choose interactive scatter plot, bar plot, heatmap, and world map. We also have considered the static graphs, streamgraphs, horizon graph, etc.. The reasons for our final choices are that interactiveness is necessary, and according to our data, the time is not strictly continuous so we cannot apply certain type of graphs that require continuity.


## Development

Zhi Jing is responsible for the scatter plots, bar plots, heatmaps, and the layout of the webpage. Yifei Wei is responsible for the world map visualization. We both contribute to the improvement of the final version of our assignment.


- Zhi Jing:
He spent about 16 hours in total for discussion, picking dataset, topic/graph design, coding, webpage layout arrangement. The coding took the most of time, about 8 hours, essentially because I have to try a lot of graph to see the effect and choose whether to use or not.

- Yifei Wei:
He spent about 15 hours in total for discussion, picking dataset, data preprocessing, coding. Regarding coding he tried a few methods to find a way to draw a world map.

## Success Story

Finding: With duration increasing, the majority of corresponding storms are tropical depression, tropical storm, hurricane, extratropical, and other low, respectively. 

This finding was discovered from fixing the duration range to 100h and slided on graph1 from left to right.
We successfully deliever the exhibition of storm tracks and their statistics.
